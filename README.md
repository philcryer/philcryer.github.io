# philcryer.github.io

This repo simply includes a [CNAME](https://github.com/philcryer/philcryer.github.io/blob/main/CNAME) file, so anything that hits this domain (philcryer.github.io) reads that, and is then redirected to my real homepage, [philcryer.com](http://philcryer.com). The source code for that site is available here: [philcryer/philcryer.com](https://github.com/philcryer/philcryer.com)

### Thanks
