								<h1>Hey, I'm <strong>Phil</strong>.</h1>
							</header>
								<p>I'm an <strong>open source technologist</strong>, <strong>privacy advocate</strong>, and <strong>hacker</strong> with a passion for art and music. I hold a bachelor's degree in fine arts, and believe that imagination is more important than knowledge. Above all I am a <strong>gently aging punk</strong> and a <strong>practicing trouble maker</strong>.</p>

					</header>
					<p>I've been painting off and on most of my life, but didn't find my voice until college. After some stops and starts, I'm recently focusing much more time on new pieces and developing new art concepts. I explore texture and contrast by constantly mixing disparate paints and materials on dense, wood panels. In future pieces I'm planning to utilize new materials, and technology, to explore new concepts.</p>

            						<p>Delivering the keynote address at Semafor-ISSA (Warsaw, Poland, 2012)</p>
					</header>
						<p>I've spoken to audiences around the world on topics of using open source software, archival techniques for scientific biodiversity data, and information security. I've spoken at infosec conferences such as DEF CON, Derbycon, B-SidesLV, SecureWorld and Semafor-ISSA. These talks focus on user's electronic rights and civil liberties while educating users about how their data is used by companies so they can to increase their privacy online. As an active member of the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) I lead online discussions on ongoing legal issues and assist in working with other grassroots groups to share knowledge.</p>

						<p>I consider myself a hacker, in the <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/hacker">positive connotation</a> of the word, and an open source technologist. I've been using open source software, including operating systems like Linux and BSD, since 1995. I know that there's always multiple ways to do things, which leads to constant learning and discovery to solve technical challenges. As my work builds on other's work, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants, so I pay it forward by sharing everything that I write as open source.</p><p><div align="right">More <a href="https://github.com/philcryer">Code, configuration, and other projects</a></p>

						<p>I have been very fortunate to travel and work with some amazing people from all over the world collaborating in the biodiversity realm, and speaking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security">infosec</a> conferences. The current list of countries I've traveled to: Mexico, Jamaica, United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada, Australia, Germany, China, France, and Poland. I love meeting new people and understanding their perspectives, so I really look forward to adding to this list of countries.</p><p><div align="right">More <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/fak3r/sets/">Pictures from my trips</a></p>
